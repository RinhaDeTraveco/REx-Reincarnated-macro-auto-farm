# HOW TO USE 
(sorry for making a so shit script) (that's not a joke) (report bugs on my discord "rinha_de_traveco" dont be shy)

1 - download AHK (https://www.autohotkey.com)

2 - Press the windows button

3 - search "Roblox Player" and open file location

4 - Right click and open file location again

5 - Contente > sounds > delete ALL the sounds

6 - put your pc volume on MAX and roblox volume on MAX. 

7 - Disable performance stats

8 - ONLY USE AT PRIVATE SERVER

# IN GAME CONFIG

ShiftLock **OFF**
Low Detail **OFF**
Background Music **OFF**
Ore Sounds **OFF**
Disguised Chill **OFF**
Mine Reset Notification **OFF**

# CLOSE EVERYTHING ON YOUR PC THAT PRODUCE SOUND EXCEPT ROBLOX
(that shit detects rare ores by dB [sound] that they produce when spawn)

Close your Broswer, Discord, Spotify, Steam, etc...

(if you got a error about "VA.ahk" don't worry, it only occurred because the AutoHotKey can't find a lib that the script need, so, to fix this, execute the macro clicking on him inside the folder "Rex reincarnated". OR create a new folder and copy paste the "VA.ahk" script [the lib script] and put the macro os the same folder of VA)
