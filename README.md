# IN GAME CONFIG

Background Music **OFF**
Ore Sounds **OFF**
Disguised Chill **OFF**
Mine Reset Notification **OFF**

# CLOSE EVERYTHING ON YOUR PC THAT PRODUCE SOUND EXCEPT ROBLOX
(that shit detects rare ores by dB [sound] that they produce when spawn)

Close your Broswer, Discord, Spotify, Steam, etc...

(if you got a error about "VA.ahk" don't worry, it only occurred because the AutoHotKey can't find a lib that the script need, so, to fix this, execute the macro clicking on him inside the folder "Rex reincarnated". OR create a new folder and copy paste the "VA.ahk" script [the lib script] and put the macro os the same folder of VA)
